[Introduction]
Welcome to the Java Calculator program! This is a simple command-line calculator built in Java that can perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

[Features]
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Error handling for division by zero and invalid operators.

[Usage]
1. **Compile the Java Program:**
   - Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you have saved the Java program (the `.java` file).
   - Compile the program using the `javac` command:
     ```bash
     javac Calculator.java
     ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   - After successful compilation, run the program with the `java` command:
     ```bash
     java Calculator
     ```

3. **Provide Input:**
   - The program will prompt you to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
   - For example:
     ```
     Simple Calculator
     Enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /):
     5
     +
     3
     ```
     Here, you enter `5` as the first number, `+` as the operator, and `3` as the second number.

4. **View Output:**
   - After you provide the input, the program will calculate and display the result.
   - For example:
     ```
     Result: 8.0
     ```
     In this example, the result of `5 + 3` is `8.0`.
